## GTA V version of [my body](https://www.facebook.com/Denis.Sergeevitch/)

MIT-licensed 3D-model of my body for GTA V game.

### How-to add Denis Shiryaev to your game:

1) Install OpenIV: 
https://openiv.com/

2) Install Enhanced Native Trainer by copying EnhancedNativeTrainer.asi and ent-config.xml into the game folder (the folder where you have GTA5.exe): 
https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/enhanced-native-trainer-zemanez-and-others 

3) Download ScriptHookV: http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/ 
Copy two .dll files (ScripthookV.dll and dinput8.dll) to your game folder.

4) Create folder "mods" inside your game folder, copy x64e.rpf to mods folder.

5) Start OpenIV, install ASI Loader, OpenIV.asi inside the OpenIV and then go to GTA5 -> Windows, enable edit mode (F6 -> yes).

6) In OpenIV navigate to GTA5\mods\x64e.rpf\models\cdimages\componentpeds_ig.rpf, hit green plus sign on the top panel, copy all the files from kolya_model.zip into the archive. This will change one of the NPC models.

7) Inside the game hit F4 to open trainer. Use numpad to navigate (4 left, 8 up, 6 right, 2 down, 5, select, 0 go back). Navigate to Player -> Player Appearance -> Change Skin -> NPCs -> Bank Manager (IG), hit numpad 5 to select.
